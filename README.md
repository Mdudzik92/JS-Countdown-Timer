<!-- Explanation of what the app is -->

This is a simple timer app created with JavaScript using DOM Manipulation to access and write to a blank HTML file. The user opens the page and watches as the time counter decrements by one second at a time until a 'colorsplosion' photo appears. What's interesting about this is that there is nothing other than an ID and a class in the HTML before it is written via invoking the JS file's functionality.
